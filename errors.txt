Error 1:

Before that we used npm install vite command for project setup instead of npm create react command.

npm install -g vite

npm install react-parallax-tilt


Due to depedency issues with REACT-TITL dependency which is only compatible with React15 and React16 NOT with React18
Solution:
 Either to upgrad or downgrade the react version I am using 
 So with React18 the new depedency will be React-parallax-tilt.

What is SVG file SVG- Scalable Vector Graphics is photo with vector-based notation useful for high resoultuion , resolution independent , high or low 
without losing quality.
